		Initializes this SP Region.
		
		**** The below parameters are for the region ****
		
		@param ninputs: The number of inputs that this region will work with.
		This value should be the same size as the number of inputs in the input
		region.
		
		@param ncolumns: The number of columns to use. The region will be
		created to be 1D with as many columns as specified.
		
		@param pct_active: The percentage of how many columns should be active
		within an inhibition radius. If None, nactive will be used.
		
		@param nactive: An alternative to pct_active, that uses a fixed	number.
		
		@param global_inhibition: Boolean to denote if global inhibition should
		be used.
				
		@param trim: Set to False to disable. If a scalar, any permanence below
		that threshold will be set to 0.
		
		@param disable_boost: Set to True to disable the boosting mechanism.
		Doing so may result in a large performance gain as well as reducing
		the memory requirements.
		
		@param seed: The random seed to use for the SP. Set to None to use the
		default seed or provide any valid seed.
		
		**** The below parameters are for the columns ****
		
		@param max_boost: The maximum boost.
		
		@param duty_cycle: The duty cycle to use for boosting. A simple moving
		average will be used based off this many past iterations.
		
		**** The below parameters are for the segments ****
		
		@param nsynapses: The number of synapses that should be connected to
		this segment.
		
		@param seg_th: The number of synapses that must be active for the
		segment to be active.
		
		**** The below parameters are for the synapses ****
		
		@param syn_th: The permanence threshold for when a connection is
		formed. This value should be between 0 and 1, exclusive.
		
		@param pinc: Permanence increment amount.
		
		@param pdec: Permanence decrement amount.
		
		@param pwindow: The offset from "syn_th", which is used to determine
		how the permanence should be initialized. The permanence will have an
		initial value between "syn_th" +/- "pwindow".
		
		@param random_permanence: If this parameter is True, the permanence
		will be randomly selected within the range bound by "pwindow". If this
		parameter is a scalar, the permanence will be fixed to that value. Note
		that clamping automatically occurs, i.e. the permanence is not allowed
		to go above or below 1 or 0, respectively. If None, the permanence will
		be initialized based off the synapse's normalized distance from its
		input. It is highly advised to use the default setting of True. The
		other two options were added for exploratory purposes only. while using
		None better follows the original SP explanation, it will likely reduce
		in a very poor initialization, rendering many synapses useless.
		
		**** Parameters for fitting (training) the SP ****
		
		@param nepochs: The number of epochs to train the SP for.
		
		@param clf: An instance of the classifier to use. The classifier must
		follow the scikit-learn interface. If this parameter is 'None', the SP
		will not be used for classification.
		
		@param log_dir: If not None, various items regarding the SP, including
		the actual instance itself will be saved in the specified directory.
